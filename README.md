# Snake Scheme Project

This was created as the final project for a Intro to Functional Programming class in February to May 2018. The goal of this project was to recreate the classic game using the Scheme language. To accomplish this I wrote a Scheme file in Dr.Racket that contains all of the logic necessary to play the snake game. 

### Getting Started 

To play this game download the code and copy it into a Dr.Racket project and run the file from within their IDE.   

### Built With 

* Dr.Racket - IDE
* Scheme - Functional programming language

### Authors 

* Kyle Dennison - KyleDennison
