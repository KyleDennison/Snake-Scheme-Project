# Snake-Scheme-Project
This was created in February to May during 2018 by myself as the final project for a Intro to Functional Programming class. The goal of this project was to recreate the classic game using the Scheme language. To accomplish this I wrote a Scheme file in Dr.Racket that contains all of the logic necessary to play the snake game.
